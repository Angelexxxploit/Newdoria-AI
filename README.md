# Newdoria Artificial Intelligence

This is my two selfmade bots Newdoria and Jewdoria, made in Node.js.
These are bots made most specifically for trading. And it will be updated when I have time.
I would not advice any novice programmer to try to run the bots,
which you can do if you download the scource code. Because it will not work without 
a config file that you would have to create yourself. You would also have to download all modules,
which is much easier to do on Linux. However, you can download the scource code if you want to. 
But it's mostly on github for being put up for display.

Current functions:

* Managing and accepting/denying trade offers
* Crafting materials
* Replying to chat messages
* Managing friend requests/group invites
