# Newdoria-Project

Bots that are made in Nodejs.

Description: I have an experiment creation. It is two of my precious side accounts that I used for my experiment. I utilized both accounts to 
transform them into autonomous, self-running bot accounts. I have named my creations Newdoria and Jewdoria. Just like how Shaw 
Tucker in fullmetal alchemist murdered his only child and his dog to make a chimerae, the accounts are useful sacrifices as my 
precious bots. I have finished the protocol that runs the bots and I have made an update log during the time I was creating them.
I'm calling my update log the Dreadlog. Instead of update log. See, pun intended. It is written in chronologic order and with 
month it was made.

Dreadlog 1, Sept: the protocol for the bot with all the actions it's trained to do is now 
finished. A laugh of hysteria as I look at this beautiful creation. After lots of nights 
tailoring every detail on it, it will soon be ready to operate. There 
are just a few errors that needs to be fixed. I expect it to take a couple more months to 
fix syntax errors and debug the script. Then it will be ready to operate.
Dreadlog 2, Oct: I have now finished a beta version of the bot. It has a basic set of things 
it can do. It can reply to messages when it is online. I can decide when I log on and I can 
run the bot from my computer singlehandedly. Without having to log in via steam. 
The bot can't automatically accept friend requests but it will be able to later when the 
full version is released. It is not online 24/7, only when I access it manually. And the bot
I have chosen for this destiny is Jewdoria, my second account. I didn't take the first one 
because then it's going to be easier to make the full version of the bot on the primary 
account without having to move things around.

Dreadlog 3, Nov: Let me announce: the full version of the bot is now launched! For both 
accounts. I have done a test run of the bot and it is fully functioning. It can still only 
function when I run it via my computer. My plan is that I am going to run it through a server
so it's up 24/7. The bot should now be able to accept friend requests and accept trade offers
when I go online.
Dreadlog 4, Dec: Me and my friend have been testing out the bot and it is fully functioning,
except for a minor bug when sending trades. It accepts any trade that is profitable. Meaning
 that if the value of the items sent to the bot is equal to or or exceeds the value of the it
ems that is traded for it, the bot will accept the trade. I have also fixed some bugs that
prevents trading and made some changes to the protocol. The bot can now do the following: 1.
Manage and accept trade offers in the way I just described. 2. Give a response to messages. 
Nothing too complicated, but it can respond to messages when it is up and running. 3. Craft.
It can craft materials from scrap when I run it. 4. Accept and manage friend and group 
requests. The only issue right now is when it gets an offer, it is a line in the protocol 
that is bugged. It gives an error message, but it still works for some reason. You can send 
a trade to the bot, and it will accept any reasonable offer. And it will complete the task 
but it won't accept any offer that is not profitable for it. So, dear reader, feel free to 
give it a shot.
