# Newdoria: Artificial Intelligence

This is my two selfmade bots Newdoria and Jewdoria, made in Node.js.

Current functions:

* Managing and accepting/denying trade offers
* Crafting materials
* Replying to chat messages
* Managing friend requests/group invites

These are bots made most specifically for trading. And it will be updated when I have time.
I would not advice any novice programmer to try to run the bots,
which you can do if you download the scource code. 
Because the 3 key files that are config files are encrypted
and not for your eyes, 
unless you're a very special snowflake. 
Hence, to run the bots, you can create: 

A: a config file.
B: modules file by downloading each module.

You have to download and install each module manually, 
probably 100+ modules. 
If one is missing, the bot will crash on startup.
This is much easier to do on Linux.
Mostly, the code on GitHub
is for putting up the main bot files for display,
along with associated coding files.
And of course to show how the bot works.

If you think this is something for you,
then feel free to send me your 5 cents of
experience and thoughts.
